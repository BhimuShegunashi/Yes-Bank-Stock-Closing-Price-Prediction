        "üèÅ Yes Bank is a well-known bank in the Indian financial domain. Since 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month. The main objective is to predict the stock‚Äôs closing price of the month.<div>\n",
        "üèÅ A bank plays an important role in maintaining the economical condition of the country. The Yes Bank crisis created panic among the people in March 2020 as it was the biggest private sector bank. The failure of a bank, be it a public sector bank or a private sector bank, can affect everyone. In March 2020, news came out that there is a high chance of a Yes bank collapse which caused panic among the depositors. The Reserve Bank of India decided to solve this issue. Reserve Bank of India superseded Yes Bank board of directors for a period of 30 days.\n",

Before we get into the specifics of creating a machine learning model, it is crucial to define the questionaries. We therefore come up with the following set of questions after performing the initial inspection of the dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "‚ô¶ The price of a share is determined by supply and demand in the market. If more people want to buy a particular stock, its price will go up. Conversely, if more people want to sell a stock, its price will go down.\n",
        "\n",
        "‚ô¶ Investors can place buy or sell orders through a broker or an online trading platform. There are two types of orders: market orders and limit orders. A market order is executed immediately at the current market price, while a limit order is executed only if the price reaches a specified limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "‚ô¶ The stock market is open for trading on weekdays, usually from 9:15 am to 3:30 pm IST. However, some exchanges may have different hours of operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "‚ô¶ The stock market is affected by various factors such as economic indicators, company earnings reports, geopolitical events, and investor sentiment. These factores may affect the volatiality of any stock.\n",

        "‚ô¶ The stock market provides investors with opportunities to earn profits through capital gains or dividends, but it also involves risks such as the potential for loss of capital.\n",
        "\n",
        "‚ô¶ The stock market plays a crucial role in the economy, as it provides companies with a means to raise capital for growth and expansion, and provides investors with an opportunity to participate in the growth of these companies.\n",

When done effectively, data visualization can also be used to tell a compelling story that helps stakeholders understand the key takeaways from a dataset. By combining data visualization and storytelling, we can create a narrative that not only conveys important insights but also resonates with the audience on an emotional level.

A common significance level is 0.05, which means that we are willing to accept a 5% chance of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true).\n",

If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the alternative hypothesis is supported by the data.
